# Key Definitions

**Investment fund** is a broad category that includes any pooled investment vehicle where multiple investors contribute money that's managed collectively. This encompasses mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds, and others.

**ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)** is a specific type of investment fund with some distinctive characteristics:

* **Trading mechanism** — ETFs trade on stock exchanges throughout the day like individual shares, so you can buy and sell at real-time prices. Traditional mutual funds only trade once daily at the closing net asset value (NAV).
* **Pricing** — ETF prices fluctuate during market hours based on supply and demand. Mutual funds are priced once at market close.
* **Minimum investment** — With ETFs you can buy a single share (or fractional shares on platforms like Trading 212). Mutual funds often have minimum investment thresholds, sometimes £500-£1,000 or more.
* **Costs** — ETFs typically have lower expense ratios, especially passive index-tracking ones. They also avoid some of the transaction costs that affect mutual funds when investors enter or exit.
* **Tax efficiency** — ETFs are generally more tax-efficient due to their "in-kind" creation/redemption process, though this matters more in certain tax jurisdictions.
* **Management style** — Most ETFs are passively managed (tracking an index), though actively managed ETFs exist. Mutual funds span both active and passive strategies.

#### **ETN vs ETF - Key Differences**

Both trade on exchanges like stocks, but they're fundamentally different instruments:

**ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)**

* **Structure**: Actual fund that owns underlying assets (stocks, bonds, commodities)
* **Ownership**: You own a share of the fund's holdings
* **Risk**: Market risk only - if the assets go down, you lose money
* **Tracking**: May have tracking error due to fees, rebalancing, sampling
* **Bankruptcy**: Protected - assets held separately from issuer
* **Tax**: Capital gains when you sell; may have dividend distributions
* **Examples**: iShares MSCI World, Vanguard S\&P 500

**ETN (Exchange Traded Note)**

* **Structure**: Unsecured debt instrument (like a bond) from a bank
* **Ownership**: You own an IOU/promise from the issuer to pay returns
* **Risk**: Market risk PLUS credit risk - issuer can go bankrupt
* **Tracking**: Usually better tracking since it's just a promise to pay the index return
* **Bankruptcy**: NOT protected - you're an unsecured creditor
* **Tax**: Can be more tax-efficient (no distributions), but complex
* **Examples**: VXX (volatility), commodity ETNs

**Simple Analogy:**

* **ETF**: Like owning a basket of fruit
* **ETN**: Like getting a promise that someone will give you fruit later
