# AWS 99.999% Architecture

The following architecture is designed for 99.999% availability with the following key features:

1. Network Architecture:
   * Dual Direct Connect connections for high availability
   * Backup VPN for failover
   * Transit Gateway for centralized routing
   * Multi-AZ deployment in all environments
2. Account Structure:
   * Management account for organizational control
   * Dedicated security account
   * Shared services account
   * Separate accounts for each environment
3. Security & Compliance:
   * Centralized security tools
   * Identity management with SSO/MFA
   * Comprehensive monitoring and logging
4. Team Access Management:
   * Development team: Full access to Dev, read access to Test
   * DevOps team: Full access to all environments and CI/CD
   * Support team: Read access to all, limited Prod support access
5. Disaster Recovery:
   * Cross-region replication
   * Backup infrastructure in DR region
   * Automated failover capabilities
6. CI/CD Pipeline:
   * Automated deployment across environments
   * Artifact versioning and storage
   * Integration with security scanning
