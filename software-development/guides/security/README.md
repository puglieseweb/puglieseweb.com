# Security

Complex systems are intrinsically insecure and security vulnerabilities and bugs will exist in hardware, operating systems, tools and application we develop and use.

So we have to accept and mitigate the risk of security vulnerabilities by:

* distributing trust.
* reduce attack surfaces.
* create isolation and compartmentalization.
* build layers of defenses.

It is important to mitigate risks by selection the right **security controls.**

Encrypting everything is the best way of mitigating the security risk that comes with a modern complex system. 

## Encryption

Encryption transform plain text in Cipher Text \(unreadable format\). In encryption we have to main component: 

* the Algorithm \(public\)
* the Key \(private\)
