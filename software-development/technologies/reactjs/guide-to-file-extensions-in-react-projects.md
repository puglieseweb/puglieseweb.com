# Guide to File Extensions in React Projects

##

### JavaScript Extensions

1. .js (JavaScript)
   * Use for: Plain JavaScript files
   * Pros:
     * Universal compatibility
     * No build step required for browsers
   * Cons:
     * No static type checking
     * May require additional setup for JSX (e.g., Babel)
2. .jsx
   * Use for: JavaScript files with JSX syntax
   * Pros:
     * Clearly indicates files containing JSX
     * Helps differentiate React components from utility files
   * Cons:
     * Requires transpilation
     * No static type checking

### TypeScript Extensions

3. .ts (TypeScript)
   * Use for: TypeScript files without JSX
   * Pros:
     * Static type checking
     * Enhanced IDE support (autocompletion, refactoring)
   * Cons:
     * Requires compilation
     * Learning curve for TypeScript
4. .tsx
   * Use for: TypeScript files with JSX syntax
   * Pros:
     * Combines benefits of TypeScript and JSX
     * Best for React components with type checking
   * Cons:
     * Requires TypeScript setup and compilation
     * Slightly more verbose than plain JS

### Recommendations

* For new projects: Consider using .tsx for components and .ts for non-JSX files. This provides the full benefits of TypeScript in a React project.
* For existing JS projects: Stick with .js or .jsx unless you're planning to migrate to TypeScript.
* For mixed projects: You can use a combination, gradually migrating to .tsx/.ts as needed.

Remember: Consistency within a project is key. Choose a convention and stick to it throughout your codebase.
