# EC2

* AWS Reserved Instances (RIs) are a way for customers to receive a discount on EC2 instance usage charges in exchange for committing to a **one-year or three-year term**. There are two types of RIs:
  * Standard RIs
  * Convertible RIs.
* Scheduled Reserved Instances are a special type of RI that allows customers to reserve instances **for specific periods of the week**, adjusting capacity based on anticipated load.
