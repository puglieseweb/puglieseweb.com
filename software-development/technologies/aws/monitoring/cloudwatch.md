# CloudWatch

* System Metrics: This are metrics that you get out of the box. The more managed the service is, the more you get.
* Application Metrics: By installing the **CloudWatch agent** you get information from inside your EC2 instances
* Alarms: alerts when something goes wrong.

Default metrics are:

* CPU Utilisation&#x20;
* Network Throughput

Custom metrics (requiring CloudWatch agent) are:

* EC2 Memory Utilization&#x20;
* ESB Storage Capacity
