# Inspector

Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed in AWS. It automatically assesses **applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices.** After the assessment Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings prioritised by level of security.

There are two types of assessment:

1. Network Assessments. Checks the ports reachable from outside the VPC.
2. Host Assessments. Checks Vulnerable software (CVE), host hardening (CIS Benchmarks), and security best practices. (r**equires Inspector agent**)
