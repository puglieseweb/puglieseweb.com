# Publish VS deploy

Currently there are two options to chose from:

1. Publish:
   1. publishing apps makes them available for others to find and deploy.&#x20;
   2. Define apps with AWS **SAM Templates**.&#x20;
   3. Set to private by default and must explicitly share if desired.
2. Deploy:
   1. Find and deploy published applications
   2. Browse public apps without needing an AWS account.
   3. Browse within the AWS Lambda console.
