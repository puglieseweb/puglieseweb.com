# Use CloudFront for Dynamic content

Let me explain how CloudFront handles dynamic content:

1. Dynamic Content Caching:
   * By default, CloudFront forwards ALL requests for dynamic content to the origin
   * Cache behavior can be configured based on HTTP headers, cookies, query strings
   * TTL (Time To Live) can be set to 0 for truly dynamic content
2. Performance Optimizations for Dynamic Content:
   * Persistent Connections: CloudFront maintains a pool of persistent connections to the origin
   * SSL/TLS Connection Reuse: Reduces handshake overhead
   * Gzip Compression: Can compress responses automatically
   * TCP Connection Management: CloudFront optimizes TCP connections from edge to origin
3. Key Features for Dynamic Content:
   * Origin Shield: Acts as an additional caching layer to reduce load on origin
   * Cache-Control Headers: Origin can control caching behavior
   * Real-time Logs: Monitor and analyze dynamic content delivery
   * Origin Failover: Automatic failover to backup origins if primary fails
4.  Configuration Options:

    ```json
    {
      "CacheBehavior": {
        "MinTTL": 0,
        "DefaultTTL": 0,
        "MaxTTL": 0,
        "ForwardedValues": {
          "Headers": ["*"],
          "Cookies": {
            "Forward": "all"
          },
          "QueryString": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```
5. Benefits for Dynamic Content:
   * Reduced Latency: Edge locations terminate client connections closer to users
   * Better Security: DDoS protection and AWS Shield integration
   * Lower Origin Load: Connection pooling and optimization
   * Global Network: Leverages AWS's global backbone network
6. Best Practices:
   * Use Cache Policies to specify which request components affect caching
   * Enable Origin Shield in the Region closest to your origin
   * Configure appropriate timeout settings
   * Monitor cache hit/miss ratios
   * Use appropriate price class based on your global needs

Even when content can't be cached, CloudFront still provides significant performance benefits through its network optimizations and connection handling.
