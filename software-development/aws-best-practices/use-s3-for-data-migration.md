# use S3 for data migration

* AWS recommends the S3 intermediary approach because:
  * S3 acts as a reliable staging area
  * Allows for data validation before loading
  * Provides checkpoint/restart capabilities
  * Enables parallel loading into Aurora
  * Keeps a backup copy of data

5. Aurora's Import Mechanisms:

* Aurora is optimized to import from S3
* Has specific tools and features for S3-based imports
* Provides better control and monitoring of the import process

Using S3 as an intermediate step, combined with AWS Snowball for the initial data transfer, provides the most reliable and efficient migration path despite seeming like an extra step.
