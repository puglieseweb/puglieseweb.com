   * Reference to competing with Oracle's database solutions

### Core Characteristics

* Fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse
* Cost-effective compared to on-premises solutions (e.g., Teradata, Netezza)
* PostgreSQL compatible
  * Supports JDBC and ODBC drivers
  * Compatible with most BI tools out of the box
* Features parallel processing
