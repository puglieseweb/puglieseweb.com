# Cloud Adoption Framework

### Understanding TOGAF (The Open Group Architectural Framework)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Overview

* Developed in 1995 as an approach for designing, planning, and implementing enterprise IT architectures
* Widely adopted by Fortune 500 companies
* Considered the de facto standard for Enterprise Architecture (EA) practice

#### Key Considerations

* Enterprise architecture is not synonymous with TOGAF
* TOGAF adoption alone doesn't guarantee proper EA practice
* Often fills process and standards gaps in organizations
* Subject to unreasonable expectations, similar to Agile methodology
* Requires interpretation and adaptation to organizational needs
* Not intended as a strict step-by-step cookbook

#### Common Misconceptions

* Not all practitioners are equally skilled
* Framework should be adapted, not followed literally
* Success depends on proper implementation and understanding
* Requires strong communication and bridge-building skills

### Framework Implementation

#### Definition and Purpose

* Frameworks provide structure for problem-solving
* Open to localization and interpretation
* Should align with organizational culture
* Not meant to be rigid or prescriptive
* Should avoid becoming bureaucratic barriers

### Cloud Adoption Framework

#### Adoption Phases

1. Pilot Project Implementation
2. Serious Development
3. Cloud Center of Excellence Establishment
4. Application Migration
5. Reinvention and Technical Debt Retirement
