2. Key features:

* End-to-end visibility
* Automated load balancing
* Blue-green deployments
* Canary releases
* Integration with AWS services (ECS, EKS, EC2)

3. Core components:

* Virtual services
* Virtual nodes
* Virtual routers
* Routes
* Virtual gateways

Best suited for complex microservices architectures needing advanced traffic management and observability.
