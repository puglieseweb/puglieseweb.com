# Route 53

### Introduction

Route 53 is AWS's DNS web service, named after the DNS port 53. It offers various routing policies to direct traffic based on different criteria and use cases.

### Routing Policy Types

## AWS Route 53 Routing Policies Decision Matrix

| Policy Type       | Decision Process                                                                                        | Example Use Case                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple            | "Simple. Here's the destination for that name."                                                         | Basic DNS mapping where a single endpoint is needed (e.g., company website) |
| Failover          | "Normally, I'd route you to , but it appears down based on my Health Checks so I'll failover to ."      | High-availability setups where backup systems are required                  |
| Geolocation       | "Looks like you're in Europe, so I'm going to route you to a resource closer to you in that region."    | Content delivery based on user location (e.g., localized content)           |
| Geoproximity      | "You're closer to the US-EAST-1 region than US-WEST-2 so I'll route you to US-EAST-1"                   | Regional service distribution with flexible geographic boundaries           |
| Latency           | "Let me see which resources has lower latency from you, then I'll direct you that way."                 | Performance optimization for global applications                            |
| Multivalue Answer | "I will return several IP addresses, as a sort of basic load balancer"                                  | Simple load balancing without need for complex load balancer setup          |
| Weighted          | "You can setup multiple resources and I'll route according to the percentage of weight you assign each" | Blue-green deployments or gradual traffic shifting between versions         |

#### 1. Simple Routing Policy

The most basic policy that maps a DNS name to a single destination. Route 53 simply returns the configured destination for the DNS query.

**Example Response:**

```
dig query returns: 52.11.7.197
```

#### 2. Failover Routing Policy

Implements active-passive failover configuration using health checks. Route 53 monitors the primary endpoint and automatically routes traffic to a backup system if the primary fails.

**Behavior:**

* Primary healthy: Routes to primary endpoint (e.g., 52.11.7.197)
* Primary unhealthy: Automatically routes to secondary endpoint (e.g., 120.13.x.x)

#### 3. Geolocation Routing Policy

Routes traffic based on the geographic location of users. Requires a default route as fallback for unidentifiable locations.

**Example Configuration:**

* North American users → Specific endpoint
* Default route → Different endpoint for all other locations

**Implementation Notes:**

* Supports various DNS record types (A, CNAME, etc.)
* Essential to configure default route as fallback

#### 4. Geoproximity Routing Policy

Routes traffic based on geographic distance between users and resources, with adjustable bias.

**Key Features:**

* Bias range: -99 to +99
* Positive bias: Expands routing radius
* Negative bias: Shrinks routing radius

**Use Case Example:** Load balancing between regions (e.g., US-EAST-1 and US-WEST-2) by adjusting geographic distribution through bias settings.

#### 5. Latency-Based Routing Policy

Routes based on lowest network latency for end users rather than geographic location.

**Example Configuration:**

```
Record 1: US-East datacenter
Record 2: EU-Central datacenter
```

Route 53 automatically directs users to the endpoint with lowest latency from their location.

#### 6. Multivalue Answer Routing

Acts as a basic load balancer by returning multiple IP addresses for a single DNS query.

**Features:**

* Returns multiple healthy endpoints
* Supports health checks
* Clients can automatically fail over to alternative IPs

#### 7. Weighted Routing Policy

Distributes traffic across multiple endpoints based on assigned weights.

**Weight Calculations:**

* Weight Range: 0-255
* Traffic Distribution = (Endpoint Weight) / (Sum of All Weights)

**Example Scenarios:**

1. Equal Distribution:
   * Endpoint 1: Weight 10
   * Endpoint 2: Weight 10
   * Result: 50% traffic to each
2. Complete Traffic Shift:
   * Endpoint 1: Weight 0
   * Endpoint 2: Weight > 0
   * Result: 100% traffic to Endpoint 2

**Common Use Case:** Blue-green deployments where traffic needs to be gradually shifted between instances.

### Implementation Considerations

1. Always configure health checks for failover scenarios
2. Set up default routes for geolocation routing
3. Use weighted routing with 0 weights for graceful traffic transitions
4. Consider latency-based routing for global applications where performance is critical

This comprehensive routing policy system allows for sophisticated traffic management scenarios, from simple one-to-one mapping to complex global distribution strategies.
