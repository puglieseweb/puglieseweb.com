Different types of Virtual Interfaces (VIFs):

* Private Virtual Interface **(Private VIF**):
  * Use when you need private connectivity to VPCs
  * For accessing private AWS resources (EC2, RDS, etc.)
  * **When you want to extend your private network to AWS**
  * Best for regular workload traffic between on-premises and AWS
  * Supports IPv4 and IPv6 private addressing
  * Requires BGP for route advertisement
* Public Virtual Interface (**Public VIF**):
  * Use when you need direct access to AWS public services
  * For accessing AWS public endpoints without internet transit
  * When you need to access AWS services like S3 or DynamoDB directly
  * **For using AWS APIs over Direct Connect**
  * Allows you to access public AWS services from your network
  * Can advertise your public IP addresses to AWS
* Transit Virtual Interface (**Transit VIF**):
  * **Use when connecting to AWS Transit Gateway**
  * For hub-and-spoke network architectures
  * When you need to connect multiple VPCs across regions
  * For complex routing scenarios requiring Transit Gateway features
  * Enables connectivity to thousands of VPCs
  * Supports multicast routing

1. Technical Limitations:
   * A private virtual interface can only be associated with either:
     * A single VPC through a Virtual Private Gateway&#x20;
     * OR a Direct Connect Gateway&#x20;
   * It cannot be associated with both simultaneously
   * Cannot "move" or "reassign" an existing VIF - it must be deleted and recreated
