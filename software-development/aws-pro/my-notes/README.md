# My notes

* Use AWS Service Catalog to create a product with a CloudFormation template that deploys the standard API Gateway and Lambda microservice, and grant users access to this product.
* Configure Action with AWS Budgets to apply custom Deny IAM policy to restrict user and role from provisioning resources or apply SCP policy or IAM policy&#x20;
