# AWS API Gateway

### Overview

API Gateway is a fully managed AWS service that enables developers to create, publish, and manage REST APIs in a scalable environment. It provides a robust platform for API hosting with various integration options and advanced features for API management.

### Core Features

#### Backend Integration Options

* AWS Lambda functions
* AWS service proxies
* HTTP-accessible endpoints
* Internal systems
* External APIs

#### Deployment Options

**Regional Deployment**

* Region-specific deployment
* Standard API access
* Direct regional endpoint access

**Edge-Optimized Deployment**

* CloudFront integration
* Global content delivery
* Reduced latency
* Improved performance

**Private Deployment**

* VPC-specific access
* Internal-only APIs
* Private networking
* Enhanced security

### API Management Features

#### Access Control

* API key management
* User identification
* Authentication integration
* Authorization controls

#### Usage Management

* Usage plans
* Throttling capabilities
* Quota management
* Rate limiting

#### Domain Management

* Custom domain support
* SNI (Server Name Indication)
* CloudFront integration
* SSL/TLS support

#### Monetization

* AWS Marketplace integration
* API productization
* Revenue generation
* Usage tracking

### Implementation Example

#### REST API Architecture

**GET Request Flow**

1. Client sends GET request (e.g., "GET customer/345")
2. API Gateway receives and processes request
3. Lambda function triggered
4. DynamoDB query executed
5. Response returned through API Gateway
6. Client receives requested data

**PUT Request Flow**

1. Client sends PUT request with payload
2. API Gateway validates request
3. Lambda function processes data
4. DynamoDB updated with new information
5. Confirmation returned to client

#### Response Caching

**Benefits**

* Reduced backend load
* Improved response times
* Lower operational costs
* Enhanced scalability

**Implementation**

* Configurable cache settings
* TTL management
* Cache invalidation options
* Size optimization

### Best Practices

#### API Design

* Use appropriate authorization
* Enable SSL/TLS
* Monitor access patterns

#### Performance

* Configure appropriate caching
* Optimize response sizes
* Monitor latency
* Implement throttling

#### Monitoring

* Set up CloudWatch metrics
* Configure logging
* Track usage patterns
* Monitor errors

### Advanced Features

#### Integration Types
