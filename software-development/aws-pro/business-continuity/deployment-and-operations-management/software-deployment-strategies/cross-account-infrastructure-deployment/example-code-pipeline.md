# Example Code Pipeline

For a proper AWS code pipeline, here's a recommended setup with multiple environments:

1. Development (Dev)

* Where developers do initial testing
* Features are developed and tested individually
* Automated tests run first
* Usually deployed automatically with each commit
* May have unstable code
* Lowest cost infrastructure setup

2. Quality Assurance (QA)

* More stable than Dev
* Integration testing environment
* Performance testing
* User acceptance testing (UAT)
* Semi-automated deployments
* Similar architecture to production but smaller scale

3. Staging/Pre-production

* Mirror of production environment
* Final testing before production
* Load testing and security testing
* Data migration testing
* Manual deployment approvals
* Similar scaling to production

4. Production (Prod)

* Live environment for end users
* Highest stability requirement
* Strict access controls
* Manual deployment approvals
* Full scaling capabilities
* High availability setup

Optional Additional Environments:

5. Hotfix

* For emergency fixes
* Bypasses regular pipeline for critical issues
* Strict access control
* Quick deployment path to production

6. Demo/Training

* Client demonstrations
* Training new team members
* Stable feature set
* Controlled data set

Key Pipeline Considerations:

```typescript
// Example CodePipeline configuration
{
  "Pipeline": {
    "Stages": [
      {
        "Name": "Source",
        "Actions": ["CodeCommit", "GitHub"]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Build",
        "Actions": ["CodeBuild"]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Dev",
        "Actions": ["AutomatedDeploy"]
      },
      {
        "Name": "QA",
        "Actions": ["ManualApproval", "Deploy"]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Staging",
        "Actions": ["ManualApproval", "Deploy"]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Production",
        "Actions": ["ManualApproval", "Deploy"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Infrastructure Recommendations:

1. Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

```yaml
# Example CloudFormation template structure
Resources:
  DevEnvironment:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    Properties:
      TemplateURL: environment-template.yml
      Parameters:
        EnvironmentType: Dev
        InstanceSize: t3.small

  ProdEnvironment:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    Properties:
      TemplateURL: environment-template.yml
      Parameters:
        EnvironmentType: Prod
        InstanceSize: t3.large
```

2. Environment-specific configurations

```json
{
  "dev": {
    "scaling": "minimal",
    "monitoring": "basic",
    "backup": "daily"
  },
  "prod": {
    "scaling": "auto",
    "monitoring": "enhanced",
    "backup": "continuous"
  }
}
```

Security Considerations:

1. Access Control

```json
{
  "dev": {
    "developers": "full-access",
    "testers": "read-write"
  },
  "prod": {
    "developers": "read-only",
    "operations": "controlled-access"
  }
}
```

2. Environment Isolation

* Separate AWS accounts for different environments
* Different VPCs for environment isolation
* Environment-specific security groups

Cost Management:

1. Resource Scaling

* Dev/QA: Smaller instances, scaled down during off-hours
* Staging: Medium sized instances, occasional scaling
* Prod: Full auto-scaling capabilities

2. Cleanup Policies

```yaml
Lifecycle:
  Dev:
    retention: 7-days
    cleanup: automatic
  Prod:
    retention: 90-days
    cleanup: manual-approval
```

Monitoring Setup:

1. CloudWatch Configuration

```json
{
  "dev": {
    "alarms": "critical-only",
    "metrics": "basic"
  },
  "prod": {
    "alarms": "comprehensive",
    "metrics": "detailed"
  }
}
```

Best Practices:

1. Automated Deployments

* Use AWS CodePipeline for orchestration
* Implement automated testing at each stage
* Configure appropriate approval gates

2. Configuration Management

* Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
* Environment-specific variables
* Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager

3. Disaster Recovery

* Regular backup testing
* Environment restoration procedures
* Documented recovery processes

4. Compliance and Auditing

* Enable AWS CloudTrail
* Implement proper logging
* Regular security assessments

This setup provides a robust pipeline while balancing development speed, stability, and cost considerations. Adjust the number of environments based on your specific needs, team size, and compliance requirements.
