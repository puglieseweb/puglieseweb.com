### Core Concepts and Definitions

#### Business Continuity vs. Disaster Recovery

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Business Continuity (BC)**
  * Focus on minimizing business disruption
  * Preventive and planning measures
  * Defines acceptable service levels
* **Disaster Recovery (DR)**
  * Response to events threatening continuity
  * Reactive measures and procedures
  * Implementation of recovery plans

#### Fault Tolerance vs. High Availability

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Fault Tolerance**
  * Complete ability to tolerate faults
  * No user-visible disruption
  * Often more expensive to implement
  * Zero downtime objective
* **High Availability**
  * Allows for minimal unplanned downtime
  * More cost-effective approach
  * Balance between reliability and cost
  * Accepts some potential disruption

### Service Level Concepts

#### Service Level Agreements (SLA)

* Commitments for quality/availability
* Not absolute guarantees
* May include compensation provisions
* Requires customer documentation for claims

#### Recovery Objectives

1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**
   * Time to restore business processes
   * Measured from disruption to recovery
   * Defines acceptable downtime
   * Key factor in BC planning
2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**
   * Acceptable data loss measured in time
   * Gap between last backup and incident
   * Influences backup strategy
   * Drives data protection requirements

### Real-World Example: The S3 Outage of 2017

#### Incident Overview

* Date: February 28, 2017
* Location: AWS Northern Virginia (us-east-1)
* Duration: 252 minutes
* Cause: Human error during system maintenance

#### Impact Analysis

* Exceeded 99.99% availability goal
* Affected multiple dependent services
* Disrupted AWS's own health dashboard
* Demonstrated cascading failure risks

#### Lessons Learned

* Human error can bypass safeguards
* Dependencies create vulnerability chains
* Need for cross-region resilience
* Importance of proper change management

### Types of Disasters

#### Infrastructure Failures

1. **Hardware Failures**
   * Network equipment malfunctions
   * Storage system crashes
   * Physical infrastructure issues
2. **Software Failures**
   * Deployment errors
   * Configuration mistakes
   * Application crashes

#### External Threats

1. **Load-Related**
   * DDoS attacks
   * Traffic spikes
   * Resource exhaustion
2. **Infrastructure**
   * Fiber cuts
   * Power outages
   * Facility issues

#### Data and System Issues

1. **Data-Induced**
   * Corruption
   * Type conversion errors
   * Invalid data processing
2. **Credential Issues**
   * Certificate expirations
   * Key rotations
   * Authentication failures

#### Resource Limitations

1. **Capacity Issues**
   * Instance type unavailability
   * Storage limitations
   * Network bandwidth constraints
2. **Identifier Exhaustion**
   * IP address depletion
   * Resource ID limitations
   * Namespace conflicts

### Best Practices

#### Planning and Prevention

* Regular backup testing
* Documentation maintenance
* Staff training
* Change management procedures

#### Implementation Strategies

1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**
   * Cross-zone redundancy
   * Load balancing
   * Automatic failover
2. **Cross-Region Solutions**
   * Geographic distribution
   * Data replication
   * Traffic routing
3. **Dependency Management**
   * Service decoupling
   * Circuit breakers
   * Fallback mechanisms

#### Monitoring and Response

* Real-time monitoring
* Automated alerts
* Incident response procedures
* Regular testing and drills

### Werner Vogels' Principle

"Everything fails all the time" - Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO

This principle emphasizes:

* Assume failure will occur
* Design for resilience
* Plan for recovery
* Test failure scenarios

### Implementation Considerations

#### Cost vs. Reliability

* Balance between protection and expense
* Tiered recovery solutions
* Risk-based investments
* Cost-benefit analysis

#### Testing Requirements

* Regular DR drills
* Failure simulation
* Recovery validation
* Documentation updates

#### Compliance and Reporting

* SLA monitoring
* Incident documentation
* Recovery metrics
* Compliance validation
