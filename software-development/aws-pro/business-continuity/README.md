During a disaster recovery plan for a client, the following statements would be correct:&#x20;

* BGP routing will redirect traffic over our VPN connection to AWS if our Direct Connect link fails.
* Route 53 has been configured to do a health check for our on-premises web server and redirect to our backup if needed.
* Failover of our Aurora PostgreSQL database will be automatic in the event of a AZ failure.
