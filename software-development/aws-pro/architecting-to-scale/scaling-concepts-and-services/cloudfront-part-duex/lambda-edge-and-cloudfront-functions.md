# Lambda@Edge and CloudFront Functions

Here's a comprehensive comparison between Lambda@Edge and CloudFront Functions:

1. Runtime Environment:

* Lambda@Edge: Node.js and Python
* CloudFront Functions: JavaScript only (ECMAScript 5.1)

2. Execution Context:

* Lambda@Edge: Can run at four stages:
  * Viewer Request
  * Origin Request
  * Origin Response
  * Viewer Response
* CloudFront Functions: Only two stages:
  * Viewer Request
  * Viewer Response

3. Performance & Scale:

* Lambda@Edge:
  * Startup latency: \~1-2ms
  * Maximum runtime: 5-30 seconds
  * Memory: 128MB to 10GB
* CloudFront Functions:
  * Startup latency: sub-millisecond
  * Maximum runtime: < 1ms
  * Memory: 2MB

4. Use Cases: Lambda@Edge:

* Complex processing
* Third-party API calls
* Large-scale manipulations
* Access to AWS services
* Cookie manipulation
* Complex redirects
* Authentication/Authorization

CloudFront Functions:

* URL rewrites/redirects
* Header manipulation
* Simple A/B testing
* Request normalization
* Simple authentication
* Cache key normalization
* Request validation

5. Pricing:

* Lambda@Edge: Pay for compute time and requests
* CloudFront Functions: Significantly cheaper, pay per request only

6. Development & Deployment: Lambda@Edge:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const request = event.Records[0].cf.request;
    const headers = request.headers;
    
    // Complex processing here
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    
    return request;
};
```

CloudFront Functions:

```javascript
function handler(event) {
    var request = event.request;
    var headers = request.headers;
    
    // Simple header manipulation
    headers['x-custom-header'] = {value: 'some-value'};
    
    return request;
}
```

7. Key Limitations: Lambda@Edge:

* Regional deployment required
* Longer cold starts
* Higher latency for complex operations

CloudFront Functions:

* No external network calls
* Limited runtime
* No filesystem access
* No access to additional AWS services

Choose CloudFront Functions when:

* You need simple, lightweight processing
* Sub-millisecond performance is crucial
* Cost optimization is important
* Processing is limited to viewer request/response

Choose Lambda@Edge when:

* You need complex processing
* External API calls are required
* You need access to AWS services
* Processing at origin request/response is needed
