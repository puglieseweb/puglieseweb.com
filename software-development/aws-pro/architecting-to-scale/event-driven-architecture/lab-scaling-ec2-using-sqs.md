# Lab: Scaling EC2 Using SQS

### Introduction

You are a solutions architect at an e-commerce firm. The company runs flash sales from time to time, and when there's a spike in orders, the fulfillment backend struggles to meet demand. In order to provide the extra instances necessary to handle those spikes in both a cost-efficient and sustainable way, you will implement Auto Scaling rules for EC2 based on metrics received from CloudWatch.

### Solution

Log in to the AWS Management Console using the credentials provided, and make sure you are in the N. Virginia (`us-east-1`) Region throughout the lab.

> **Note**: AWS may take a few minutes to populate the metrics in CloudWatch.

#### Create CloudWatch Alarms

**Connect to Your EC2 Instances**

1. Navigate to **EC2** using the **Services** menu or the unified search bar.
2. From the **Resources**, select **Instances (running)**.
3. Connect to and configure your **Bastion Host** instance:
   * Check the checkbox to the left of your **Bastion Host** instance.
   *   Along the top of the page, click **Connect**, and then click **Connect**.

       Your instance is provisioned in a separate browser tab. This may take a few minutes.
   *   After your instance is provisioned, switch the user from `root` to `cloud_user`:

       ```
       su - cloud_user
       ```
   *   List the contents of your current directory:

       ```
       ls
       ```

       You should see the `send_messages.py` script listed.
   *   Run the `send_messages.py` script:

       ```
       ./send_messages.py
       ```

       The script sends messages to your SQS queue to simulate orders coming into your instance.
4. Navigate back to the **EC2 Management Console** browser tab, and use the breadcrumb along the top of the page to select **Instances**.
5. Connect to and configure your **AutoScaling Group** instance:
   * Check the checkbox to the left of your **AutoScaling Group** instance.
   *   Along the top of the page, click **Connect**, and then click **Connect**.

       Again, your instance is provisioned in a separate browser tab.
   *   After your instance is provisioned, switch the user from _root_ to _cloud\_user_:

       ```
       su - cloud_user
       ```
   *   List the contents of your current directory:

       ```
       ls
       ```

       You should see the `receive_messages.log` file and the `receive_messages.py` script listed.
   *   Review the log file:

       ```
       tail -f receive_messages.log
       ```

       You should see that the instance is continuously retrieving messages from the queue. You'll need more EC2 instances to support these incoming messages.
6. Leave both terminals open and running.

**Create a Scale-Out Alarm**

1. In a separate browser tab, navigate to **CloudWatch** using the **Services** menu or the unified search bar.
2. From the **Get started with CloudWatch** options in the main pane, select **Create alarms**.
3. Click **Create alarm**.
4. In the **Metric** section, click **Select metric**.
5. From the **Metrics** options, select **SQS**, and then select **Queue Metrics**.

7. Click **Select metric**.
8. Configure the metric conditions:
   * **Period**: Use the dropdown to select **1 minute**.
   * **Threshold type**: Ensure that **Static** is selected.
   * **Whenever ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible is...**: Ensure that **Greater** is selected.
   * **than...**: Enter _500_ into the text field.
9. Leave all other default settings and click **Next**.
10. Configure the alarm actions:
    * **Alarm state trigger**: Ensure that **In alarm** is selected.
    * **Send a notification tot he following SNS topic**: Ensure that **Select an existing SNS topic** is selected.
    * **Send a notification to...**: Click into the text field and select the **AutoScalingTopic**.
11. Leave all other default settings and click **Next**.
12. In the **Alarm name** field, enter _Scale Out_.
13. Leave the existing alarm description and click **Next**.
14. Review the alarm details and then click **Create alarm**.

**Create a Scale-In Alarm**

1. In the top right corner, click **Create alarm**.
2. In the **Metric** section, click **Select metric**.
3. From the **Metrics** options, select **SQS**, and then select **Queue Metrics**.
4. Check the checkbox to the left of the metric named `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`.
5. Click **Select metric**.
6. Configure the metric conditions:
   * **Period**: Use the dropdown to select **1 minute**.
   * **Threshold type**: Ensure that **Static** is selected.
   * **Whenever ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible is...**: Select **Lower**.
   * **than...**: Enter _500_ into the text field.
7. Leave all other default settings and click **Next**.
8. Configure the alarm actions:
   * **Alarm state trigger**: Ensure that **In alarm** is selected.
   * **Send a notification tot he following SNS topic**: Ensure that **Select an existing SNS topic** is selected.
   * **Send a notification to...**: Click into the text field and select the **AutoScalingTopic**.
9. Leave all other default settings and click **Next**.
10. In the **Alarm name** field, enter _Scale In_.
11. Leave the existing alarm description and click **Next**.
12. Review the alarm details and then click **Create alarm**.

    At this point, you should see that the **Scale Out** alarm is in an **In alarm** state.

**Test the Scale-Out Alarm**

1. In the **CloudWatch** sidebar menu, expand the **Metrics** section and select **All metrics**.
2. From the **Metrics** options, select **SQS**, and then select **Queue Metrics**.

   * **And then wait**: In the text field, enter _60_.
6.  After the policy details are complete, click **Create**.

    The policy should be successfully created and enabled.
7. In the **Dynamic policies** section, select **Create dynamic scaling policy** again.
8. Fill in the scale-in policy details:
   * **Policy type**: Use the dropdown to select **Simple scaling**.
   * **Scaling policy name**: In the text field, enter _Scale In_.
   * **CloudWatch alarm**: Use the dropdown to select **Scale In**.
   * **Take the action**: Set the action to **Remove 1 capacity units**.
   * **And then wait**: In the text field, enter _60_.
9.  After the policy details are complete, click **Create**.

    The policy should be successfully created and enabled.
10. Select the **Activity** tab.

    After a few minutes, you should see a new instance is launched as a result of the scale-out policy.

#### Observe the Auto Scaling Group's Behavior in CloudWatch

1.  Navigate to the **CloudWatch Management Console** browser tab.

    You should now see a number of messages reflected in your graph.
2. Navigate to the **EC2 Instance Connect** browser tab for your **Bastion Host** instance.
3.  Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the instance from sending messages.

    This simulates an end in your order sales.
4. After the messages stop sending, close out of the browser tab.
5. Navigate to the **EC2 Instance Connect** browser tab for your **AutoScaling Group** instance and note that it is still receiving messages.
6. Navigate to the **CloudWatch Management Console** browser tab and wait approximately 5â€“10 minutes to see the downward trend of messages reflected in your graph.
7.  After verifying the downward trend of messages is reflected in your graph, use the **CloudWatch** sidebar menu to expand **Alarms** and then select **In alarm**.

    You should now see that your **Scale In** alarm is in an **In alarm** state. If it's not, your message count may not be below 500 just yet.
8.  Navigate to the **Auto Scaling group** browser tab and refresh the **Activity history** section.

    You should see your EC2 instances beginning to terminate. Remember that you configured your scale-in policy to remove instances at a rate of one every 60 seconds.
9. After a minute, refresh the activity history again to confirm that another instance is terminating.
