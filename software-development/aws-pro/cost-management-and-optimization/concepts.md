# Concepts

### Basic Cost Concepts

#### Capital Expenses (CapEx)

* Money spent on long-term assets
* Examples:
  * Data centers
  * Computer equipment
  * Infrastructure hardware
* Typically depreciated over time
* Large upfront investments

#### Operational Expenses (OpEx)

* Regular business running costs
* Variable expenses that scale with usage
* Pay-as-you-go model
* Flexible spending based on needs

### Traditional IT Budgeting Cycle

#### Depreciation-Based Planning

* Typically follows 5-year cycles
* Large purchases made at extended intervals
* Requires long-term capacity prediction
* Significant scrutiny on budget requests

#### Common Capacity Scenarios

1. Ideal Scenario
   * Gradual capacity consumption
   * Fixed costs regardless of usage
2. Under-Utilization Scenario
   * Excess aging IT assets
   * Wasted resources
   * Opportunity costs
3. Over-Utilization Scenario
   * Demand exceeds capacity
   * Emergency purchases required
   * Higher costs due to:
     * Lack of bulk pricing
     * Mixed equipment models
     * Increased maintenance complexity

### Cloud Computing Cost Model

#### Pay-as-you-go Benefits

* Variable cost structure
* Capacity aligned with demand
* No upfront commitments
* Resource scaling flexibility

#### True Cloud vs. Traditional Hosting

* True cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP):
  * Genuine pay-per-use models
  * No long-term commitments required
* Traditional hosting providers:
  * Fixed-fee contracts
  * Multi-year commitments
  * Similar to CapEx model

### Financial Analysis Concepts

#### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

* Comprehensive cost analysis
* Includes:
  * Hard costs (direct expenses)
  * Soft costs (indirect expenses)
  * Often overlooked elements:
    * Power and cooling
    * Fire suppression
    * Real estate
    * Maintenance overhead

#### Return on Investment (ROI)

* Expected returns from investments
* Can include:
  * Positive returns
  * Break-even scenarios
  * Loss mitigation

### Cloud Migration Considerations

#### Learning Curve Impact

* Initial higher expenses likely
* Temporary inefficiencies
* Staff adaptation period
* Long-term benefit realization

#### Business Planning Challenges

* Multiple layers of assumptions
* Interdependent project impacts
* Market condition influences
* Critical path dependencies

### Best Practices

#### Financial Analysis

* Collaborate with finance department
* Base calculations on factual data
* Consider all cost components
* Account for soft costs
* Plan for learning curves

#### Planning Considerations

* Realistic timeline development
* Comprehensive cost analysis
* Stakeholder involvement
* Regular plan reviews
* Flexibility for market changes
