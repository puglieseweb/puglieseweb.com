# AWS Cost Optimization Strategies

## AWS Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Appropriate Provisioning

#### Resource Management

* Provision only necessary resources
* Monitor and shut down unused instances
* Use CloudWatch for utilization monitoring

#### Consolidation Strategies

* Combine similar resources for better efficiency
* Example: Consolidating DynamoDB databases
  * Multiple small databases have minimum provisioning requirements
  * Consolidation enables better utilization of read/write capacity units
* Case study: Database consolidation
  * Original: Four db.t2.small multi-AZ databases at $287.80
  * Consolidated: Single larger database for cost savings

### 2. Right-Sizing

#### Implementation Strategies

* Use lowest-cost resources meeting technical requirements
* Design for consistent resource utilization
* Implement loosely coupled architectures
  * Smooths demand patterns
  * Reduces spikes and valleys
  * Creates predictable demand profiles

### 3. Purchase Options

#### Instance Purchasing Strategies

* Reserved Instances
  * Best for permanent applications
  * Significant cost savings for long-term use
* Spot Instances
  * Ideal for temporary horizontal scaling
  * Maximum cost savings (up to 79% off on-demand)
* EC2 Fleet
  * Defines target mix of instance types
  * Combines On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances

#### Pricing Example (m5.2xlarge)

* On-demand price: $0.38
* 1-year reserve: 40% savings
* Spot instance: 79% savings

### 4. Regional Price Optimization

#### Considerations

* Prices vary by region
* Lower-cost regions for non-location-specific services
* Use CloudFront and Route 53 for latency management

#### Example: S3 Standard Storage (First 50 TB)

* us-west-2: Lowest cost per gigabyte
* Costs increase in other regions

### 5. Managed Services Utilization

#### Benefits

* Reduced administrative overhead
* Lower total cost of ownership
* Decreased complexity

#### Recommended Services

* RDS instead of EC2 for MySQL
* Redshift
* Fargate
* MapReduce (EMR)

### 6. Data Transfer Optimization

#### Cost Considerations

* Inbound data transfer: Free
* Outbound and inter-region transfer: Charged
* Significant impact on total costs

#### Direct Connect Evaluation

* Higher upfront costs
* Potentially more cost-effective long-term
* Depends on:
  * Data volume requirements
  * Speed requirements
  * Transfer patterns

### Best Practices

* Regular resource utilization review
* Proactive monitoring and adjustment
* Balance between performance and cost
* Consider long-term vs. short-term needs
* Evaluate managed service opportunities
