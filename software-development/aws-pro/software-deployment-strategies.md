# Software Deployment Strategies

We have 3 main deployments strategies:

1. **Big Bang Deployment**:
   * Fastest full deployment but highest risk.
   * All changes are made at once, which can be overwhelming for users and support staff.
   * Best for smaller systems or organizations that can afford some downtime and rapid change.
2. **Phased Rollout**:
   * Slower full deployment but lower risk.
   * Changes are introduced gradually, allowing for adjustments and learning along the way.
   * Good for large, complex systems where a complete overhaul would be too disruptive.
3. **Parallel Adoption**:
   * Medium to long deployment time with moderate risk.
   * Allows for thorough testing and comparison between old and new systems.
   * Ideal for critical systems where continuity is crucial and the organization can afford to run two systems simultaneously.

The choice between these strategies depends on various factors including:

* The size and complexity of the system being deployed
* The organization's tolerance for risk and disruption
* Available resources (time, money, personnel)
* The criticality of the system to business operations

It's worth noting that in practice, organizations often use hybrid approaches or variations of these strategies to best suit their specific needs and constraints.

## Comparison of Software Deployment Strategies

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**               | Complete system replacement in a single event     | Gradual implementation in stages or modules | Running old and new systems simultaneously for a period   |
| **Time to Full Deployment**  | Short                                             | Long                                        | Medium to Long                                            |
| **Risk Level**               | High                                              | Low to Medium                               | Medium                                                    |
| **Disruption to Operations** | High                                              | Low                                         | Low to Medium                                             |
| **Resource Requirements**    | High (short-term)                                 | Medium (spread out)                         | High (need to maintain two systems)                       |
| **Rollback Difficulty**      | Very Difficult                                    | Easy                                        | Easy                                                      |
| **User Adaptation**          | Challenging (sudden change)                       | Easier (gradual change)                     | Moderate (users can compare)                              |
| **Testing Thoroughness**     | Must be extremely thorough before deployment      | Can test each phase separately              | Can thoroughly test while old system is still operational |
| **Cost**                     | Lower upfront, potentially higher if issues occur | Higher due to longer implementation time    | Higher due to running parallel systems                    |
| **Best Suited For**          | Smaller organizations or less critical systems    | Large, complex systems or organizations     | Critical systems where failure is not an option           |
