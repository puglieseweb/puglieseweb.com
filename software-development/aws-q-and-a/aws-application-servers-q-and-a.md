# AWS Application Servers Q\&A

## What are the availability SLAs for the different AWS Application SLAs?&#x20;

| Service           | Monthly Region-Level Availability SLA | Monthly Instance-Level (or equivalent) Availability SLA |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2               | 99.99%                                | 99.5% for individual EC2 instances                      |
| ECS               | 99.99%                                | No specific instance-level SLA                          |
| EKS               | 99.95%                                | No specific instance-level SLA                          |
| Elastic Beanstalk | No specific SLA published             | No specific instance-level SLA                          |
| App Runner        | No specific SLA published             | No specific instance-level SLA                          |
| Lambda            | 99.95%                                | No specific instance-level SLA (serverless)             |

## What are the difference between Beanstalk and App Runner?

Both AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS App Runner are managed services designed to simplify application deployment, but they have some key differences:

1. Level of abstraction:
   * Elastic Beanstalk: Provides a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment with more control over the underlying infrastructure.
   * App Runner: Offers a higher level of abstraction, focusing on a source-to-service experience with less infrastructure management
2. Infrastructure control:
   * Elastic Beanstalk: Allows more fine-grained control over EC2 instances, load balancers, and other AWS resources.
   * App Runner: Abstracts away most infrastructure details, managing them automatically.
3. Scaling:
   * Elastic Beanstalk: Offers both time-based and metric-based auto-scaling options.
   * App Runner: Provides automatic scaling based on incoming traffic, with less configuration required.
4. Deployment options:
   * Elastic Beanstalk: Supports various deployment strategies (rolling, immutable, blue/green) and can deploy from multiple sources (ZIP, Docker, Git).
   * App Runner: Primarily designed for deploying from source code repositories or container registries.
5. Language/framework support:
   * Elastic Beanstalk: Supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks through preconfigured platforms.
   * App Runner: Initially focused on containerized applications, but now also supports source code deployments for specific runtimes.
6. Customization:
   * Elastic Beanstalk: Offers extensive customization options through configuration files and extension hooks.
   * App Runner: Provides fewer customization options, focusing on simplicity and rapid deployment.
7. Use cases:
   * Elastic Beanstalk: Better suited for applications that require more control over the infrastructure or have complex deployment requirements.
   * App Runner: Ideal for simpler web applications, microservices, or APIs that benefit from a streamlined deployment process.
8. Pricing model:
   * Elastic Beanstalk: You pay for the AWS resources used (e.g., EC2 instances, load balancers).
   * App Runner: Charges based on the compute and memory resources consumed by your application, with a simpler pricing structure.

In summary, Elastic Beanstalk offers more control and flexibility but requires more configuration, while App Runner provides a simpler, more automated experience with less customization. The choice between them often depends on your application's complexity, your team's expertise, and your specific requirements for infrastructure control.

## What are the difference between Beanstalk and ECS?

Amazon Elastic Beanstalk:

1. Abstraction level: Higher-level, Platform as a Service (PaaS)
2. Ease of use: Simpler, more automated
3. Application types: Supports various programming languages and web servers
4. Container support: Can deploy containerized applications, but not its primary focus
5. Scaling: Automatic scaling based on predefined rules
6. Infrastructure management: Handles most infrastructure details automatically

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS):

1. Abstraction level: Lower-level, container orchestration service
2. Ease of use: More complex, offers greater control
3. Application types: Specifically designed for containerized applications
4. Container support: Native support for Docker containers
5. Scaling: Manual or automatic scaling with more granular control
6. Infrastructure management: Requires more hands-on management

Key differences:

1. Purpose: Beanstalk is for easy deployment of web applications, while ECS is specifically for container orchestration.
2. Flexibility: ECS offers more flexibility and control over your container infrastructure, while Beanstalk abstracts away many details for simplicity.
3. Learning curve: Beanstalk has a gentler learning curve, while ECS requires more in-depth knowledge of containerization and orchestration.
4. Integration: ECS integrates more deeply with other AWS services for container management, like ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
5. Use cases: Beanstalk is ideal for simple web applications and developers who want to focus on code. ECS is better for complex, containerized microservices architectures.

## What are the Application Server Options for AWS?

1. **AWS Lambda (Serverless)**
   * Language support: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, .NET, Ruby
   * Pros:
     * Serverless, no infrastructure management
     * Auto-scaling
     * Pay only for compute time used
   * Cons:
     * Cold starts can increase latency
     * Limited execution time (15 minutes max)
   * Best for: Event-driven, sporadic workloads, microservices
2. **Amazon EC2 (Traditional)**
   * EC2, which offers a 99.99% availability SLA
   * Language support: Any (you have full control over the instance)
   * Pros:
     * Full control over the environment
     * Wide range of instance types for different needs
     * Can run any web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or application server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty)
   * Cons:
     * Requires more management and configuration
     * You're responsible for scaling and maintenance
   * Best for: Applications requiring specific configurations, high-performance computing
3. **Amazon ECS (Container-based)**
   * Language support: Any (containerized applications)
   * Pros:
     * Easy container orchestration
     * Works well with Docker
     * Integrates with other AWS services
   * Cons:
     * Steeper learning curve if you're new to containers
     * More complex than serverless options
   * Best for: Microservices architectures, applications already containerized
4. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
   * Language support: Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Docker
   * Pros:
     * Easy to use, handles deployment details
     * Auto-scaling and load balancing built-in
     * Supports multiple platforms
   * Cons:
     * Less flexible than managing your own EC2 instances
     * May not be suitable for very complex applications
   * Best for: Web applications, developers who want to focus on code rather than infrastructure
5. **AWS App Runner**
   * Language support: Any (via containers)
   * Pros:
     * Fully managed
     * Automatic scaling and load balancing
     * Simple to use, quick to deploy
   * Cons:
     * Less customizable than ECS or EC2
     * Newer service, so fewer features than more established options
   * Best for: Web applications, APIs, microservices, especially for teams wanting simplicity
