A company has a custom application running on an Amazon EC instance that: \* Reads a large amount of data from Amazon S3 \* Performs a multi-stage analysis \* Writes the results to Amazon DynamoDB The application writes a significant number of large, temporary files during the multi-stage analysis. The process performance depends on the temporary storage performance. What would be the fastest storage option for holding the temporary files? **A.** Multiple Amazon S3 buckets with Transfer Acceleration for storage. **B.** Multiple Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) drives with Provisioned IOPS and EBS optimization. **C.** Multiple Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volumes using the Network File System version 4.1 (NFSv4.1) protocol. **D.** Multiple instance store volumes with software RAID 0.

Edit

Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what we need:
   * Storage for temporary files
   * High performance requirement
   * Local processing on an EC2 instance
2.  Let's analyze each option: A. Amazon S3 with Transfer Acceleration

    * Network-based storage
    * Higher latency due to API calls
    * Not ideal for frequent read/write operations

    B. Multiple EBS volumes with Provisioned IOPS

    * Network-attached block storage
    * Good performance but still has network overhead
    * Consistent and predictable performance

    C. Amazon EFS with NFSv4.1

    * Network-based file system
    * Higher latency than block storage
    * Better for shared access than temporary files

    D. Instance store volumes with RAID 0

    * Direct attached storage (physically attached to host)
    * Lowest possible latency
    * RAID 0 provides increased throughput
    * No network overhead
3. For temporary files during processing:
   * Local storage will be faster than network storage
   * Instance store provides direct hardware access
   * RAID 0 across multiple volumes increases performance
   * No network latency involved

The correct answer is **D. Multiple instance store volumes with software RAID 0.**

This is the fastest option because:

1. Instance store provides direct hardware access with no network overhead
2. Multiple volumes in RAID 0 configuration provide parallel I/O
3. Perfect for temporary files as the storage is ephemeral anyway
4. No network bottlenecks compared to EBS, EFS, or S3
