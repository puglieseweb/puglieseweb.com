# Apache Cassandra (Amazon Keyspaces)

**Apache Cassandra** is a distributed database (e.g. it runs on many machines) that uses NoSQL. It's primarily used for **big data solutions**. Enterprises, such as Netflix, use Cassandra on their backend.



**Amazon Keyspaces** allows to run Cassandra workloads on AWS and is a fully managed database service. Keyspaces is serverless: you pay for only the resources you use, and the service can automatically scale tables up and down in response to applications workloads. With Amazon Keyspaces you don't need to worry about managing servers, software, patching, etc.
