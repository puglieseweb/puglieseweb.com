# EC2 Instance Types

EC2 offers a wide variety of instance types optimized for different use cases. Each instance type is grouped into an instance family and provides different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

#### Instance Families:

1. General Purpose (T, M, A)
   * Balanced compute, memory, and networking resources
   * Use cases: Web servers, small databases
2. Compute Optimized (C)
   * High-performance processors
   * Use cases: Batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers
3. Memory Optimized (R, X, Z)
   * Fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory
   * Use cases: High-performance databases, distributed memory caches
4. Storage Optimized (I, D, H)
   * High, sequential read/write access to large datasets on local storage
   * Use cases: Data warehousing, distributed file systems
5. Accelerated Computing (P, G, F)
   * Hardware accelerators or co-processors
   * Use cases: Machine learning, graphics processing, video encoding

#### Comparison Table of Common EC2 Instance Types:

| Instance Type | vCPU | Memory (GiB) | Storage          | Network Performance | Use Case                                         |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| t3.micro      | 2    | 1            | EBS-Only         | Up to 5 Gigabit     | Low traffic websites, small applications         |
| m5.large      | 2    | 8            | EBS-Only         | Up to 10 Gigabit    | Small to medium databases, data processing tasks |
| c5.large      | 2    | 4            | EBS-Only         | Up to 10 Gigabit    | Web servers, batch processing                    |
| r5.large      | 2    | 16           | EBS-Only         | Up to 10 Gigabit    | Memory-intensive applications                    |
| i3.large      | 2    | 15.25        | 1 x 475 NVMe SSD | Up to 10 Gigabit    | NoSQL databases, data warehousing                |
| p3.2xlarge    | 8    | 61           | EBS-Only         | Up to 10 Gigabit    | Machine learning, high-performance computing     |

#### Key Points to Remember:

1. Instance type naming convention: \[Instance Family]\[Generation]\[Additional Capabilities].\[Size] For example, in "m5.large":
   * 'm' is the instance family (General Purpose)
   * '5' is the generation
   * 'large' is the size within that type
2. As you move up in size within an instance type (e.g., from t3.micro to t3.small to t3.medium), you generally get proportionally more vCPU and memory.
3. Some instance types are EBS-optimized by default, providing additional, dedicated capacity for EBS I/O.
4. Newer generations within a family typically offer better performance and newer features.
5. Some specialized instance types offer additional features:
   * GPU instances (P and G families) for graphics and general-purpose GPU compute applications
   * FPGA instances (F1) for custom hardware acceleration
6. When choosing an instance type, consider:
   * The specific requirements of your application (CPU, memory, storage, network)
   * The workload patterns (steady-state, variable, or burst)
   * Cost optimization (different instance types have different pricing)

Remember, AWS frequently introduces new instance types and retires older ones, so always refer to the official AWS documentation for the most up-to-date information.
