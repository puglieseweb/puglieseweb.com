# Clustering Algorithms in Machine Learning

### Introduction

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points into clusters without predefined labels. Unlike supervised learning (regression/classification), clustering works with unlabeled data to discover inherent patterns and structures.

### Types of Clustering Approaches

#### 1. By Assignment Method

**Hard Clustering**

* **Definition**: Each data point belongs to exactly one cluster
* **Characteristics**:
  * Mutually exclusive assignments
  * Clear boundaries between clusters
* **Example Algorithm**: K-means
* **Example**: Sorting fruits by distinct colors (red, green, yellow)

**Soft Clustering**

* **Definition**: Data points can belong to multiple clusters with different probabilities
* **Characteristics**:
  * Probability-based assignment
  * Allows overlap between clusters
* **Example Algorithm**: Fuzzy C-means
* **Example**: Sorting fruits with mixed colors (greenish-yellow, reddish-orange)

### Major Categories of Clustering Algorithms

#### 1. Centroid-Based Clustering

* **Key Characteristics**:
  * Predefined number of clusters
  * Iterative refinement of cluster centers
* **Process**:
  1. Initialize random centroids
  2. Assign points to nearest centroid
  3. Update centroids based on mean
  4. Repeat until convergence
* **Distance Metrics**:
  * Euclidean distance
  * Manhattan distance
* **Popular Algorithm**: K-means
* **Best For**: Well-separated, spherical clusters

#### 2. Density-Based Clustering

* **Key Characteristics**:
  * No predefined number of clusters
  * Discovers arbitrary shapes
  * Handles outliers well
* **Process**:
  1. Select random point
  2. Examine neighborhood within radius
  3. Form cluster if density threshold met
  4. Connect density-reachable points
* **Popular Algorithm**: DBSCAN
* **Best For**: Irregular-shaped clusters, noisy data

#### 3. Connectivity-Based (Hierarchical) Clustering

* **Key Characteristics**:
  * Creates hierarchy of clusters
  * Visualized as dendrogram
*   **Types**:

    **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up)**

    * Start: Each point is a cluster
    * Process: Merge similar clusters
    * Direction: Bottom to top

    **Divisive (Top-Down)**

    * Start: All points in one cluster
    * Process: Split dissimilar points
    * Direction: Top to bottom
* **Best For**: Hierarchical data relationships

#### 4. Distribution-Based Clustering

* **Key Characteristics**:
  * Based on probability distributions
  * Uses statistical models
* **Process**:
  1. Estimate distribution parameters
  2. Use expectation maximization
  3. Assign probabilities to points
* **Popular Algorithm**: Gaussian Mixture Models
* **Best For**: Overlapping clusters, statistical analysis
