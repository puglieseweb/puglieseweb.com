# AI, Analytics, Big Data, ML

We can thinking about AI, Analytics, Big Data and ML in this way:

* Analytics is the overall goal (getting insights from data)
* Big Data provides the infrastructure and methods to handle massive datasets
* Machine Learning is one powerful tool used within analytics to find patterns and make predictions
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broader field that aims to create systems that can simulate human intelligence, with ML being one of its key subsets that focuses specifically on learning from data

You could visualize it as a hierarchy:

```
CopyAI (Broadest: Creating intelligent systems)
    ↳ Analytics (Getting insights from data)
        ↳ Big Data (Infrastructure & Processing)
            ↳ Machine Learning (Learning patterns from data)
```

Another way to frame it:

* AI is like the brain (general intelligence capability)
* Analytics is like the reasoning process
* Big Data is like the memory and processing power
* ML is like the learning mechanism
