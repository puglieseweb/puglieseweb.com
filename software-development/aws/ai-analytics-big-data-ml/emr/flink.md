# Flink

Flink is both Stream and Batch. It is used for basic data processing, machine learning, real-time analytics.

In Apache Flink, when dealing with streaming data, Watermarks are used to handle out-of-order events based on the concept of event time, ensuring that the state of computations can be accurately determined even if data arrives late.
