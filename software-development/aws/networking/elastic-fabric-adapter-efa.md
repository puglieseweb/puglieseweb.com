# Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)

EFA is a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances designed to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications.

Key points about AWS EFA:

1. Performance: It provides lower latency and higher throughput compared to traditional TCP transport.
2. OS-bypass: EFA enables direct communication between applications and the network adapter, bypassing the operating system kernel.
3. Compatibility: It works with popular HPC and machine learning frameworks and libraries.
4. Scalability: EFA is designed to scale to thousands of CPUs or GPUs.
5. Use cases: It's particularly useful for tightly-coupled applications like computational fluid dynamics, weather modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations.
