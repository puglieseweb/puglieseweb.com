# Real-time interfaces

Here are the key steps to deploy real-time interfaces in SageMaker:

1. Prepare Model

* Package your trained model with inference code
* Create model.tar.gz containing the model artifacts and inference.py script

2. Create SageMaker Model

* Use CreateModel API/console to register your model
* Specify container image and model artifacts location in S3

3. Create Endpoint Configuration

* Define instance type (e.g. ml.t2.medium)
* Set number of instances for scaling
* Configure production variants if A/B testing

4. Create Endpoint

* Deploy using the endpoint configuration
* Wait for status to become "InService"
* Get endpoint name/URL for making predictions

5. Invoke Endpoint

* Use InvokeEndpoint API for real-time predictions
* Send properly formatted input data
* Get predictions in response

The minimum required components are:

```python
# Basic deployment flow
model = Model(
    model_data='s3://bucket/model.tar.gz',
    image_uri=container_uri,
    role=role)

predictor = model.deploy(
    instance_type='ml.t2.medium',
    initial_instance_count=1)
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps?
