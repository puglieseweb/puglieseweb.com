# General considerations

### Data Transfer

VPC Endpoints:

1. Security: Provide a private connection within the VPC, not traversing the public internet
2. Performance: Can offer lower latency due to direct connectivity
3. Cost: May reduce data transfer costs, especially for large volumes of data
4. Complexity: Require some additional configuration and management

Internet Public Transport:

1. Security: Data travels over the public internet, requiring encryption
2. Performance: Subject to internet congestion and potential latency issues
3. Cost: Standard data transfer costs apply
4. Complexity: Generally simpler to set up and use
