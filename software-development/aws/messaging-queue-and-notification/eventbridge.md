# EventBridge

AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's designed to make it easier for applications to communicate with each other using events. Here's a brief overview of its key features and uses:

1. Event routing: EventBridge can receive events from various AWS services, SaaS applications, and your own applications, then route these events to target services.
2. Serverless: As a fully managed service, there's no infrastructure to manage. It scales automatically to match your application's event volume.
3. Event filtering: It allows you to set up rules to filter events based on their content, ensuring only relevant events trigger specific actions.
4. Multiple targets: A single event can be sent to multiple targets, allowing for complex event-driven architectures.
5. Custom event buses: You can create custom event buses for your applications, in addition to the default event bus that receives events from AWS services.
6. Schema registry: EventBridge can infer schemas from events and store them in a registry, making it easier to understand event structures.
7. Integration: It integrates with many AWS services like Lambda, SNS, SQS, and Step Functions, as well as external SaaS providers.
8. Cross-account event routing: Events can be shared across different AWS accounts within an organization.

EventBridge is particularly useful for building decoupled, event-driven architectures. It's often used in microservices architectures, for monitoring application states, automating workflows, and integrating various components of a distributed system.
