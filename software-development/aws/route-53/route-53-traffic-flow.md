# Route 53 Traffic Flow

You can use Route 53 Traffic Flow to build a routing system using a combination of:

* geographic location
* letancy
* and availability to route traffic

from users to the cloud or on-premises endpoints.



## Geoproximity Routing (Traffic Flow only)

* Geoproximity routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources.
* You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to given resources by specifying a value, known as **bias**.
* **A Bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to the resource.**
