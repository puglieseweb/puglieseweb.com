# EFS (Elastic File System)

EFS (Elastic File System): When you need a **distributed, highly resilient storage** for Linux instances and Linux-based applications. EFS is Managed NAS (Network Attached Storage) solution.

* Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol&#x20;
* Only Pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required)
* Can scale up to petabytes
* Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
* Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region
* Read-after-write consistency

## EFS throughput modes

Choose Provisioned when you need consistent performance above baseline or can't rely on burst credits. Choose Bursting for variable workloads where occasional performance spikes are acceptable.

### Bursting Throughput

* Baseline performance of 50 KB/s per GB of storage
* Accumulates burst credits when not using full baseline
* Can burst up to 100 MB/s when needed using credits
* Better for variable workloads with periodic spikes
* More cost-effective for inconsistent usage patterns

### Provisioned Throughput

* **Allows you to specify required throughput regardless of storage size**
* Charged for provisioned amount whether used or not
* Can be increased/decreased as needed
* Measured in MiB/s
* Ideal for applications requiring consistent, predictable performance
* Better for high-performance workloads that need guaranteed throughput

## Example

A 100 GB file system with bursting mode would have:

* Baseline: 5 MB/s (100 GB Ã— 50 KB/s)
* Burst: Up to 100 MB/s using burst credits

## EFS Types

* Standard offers highest availability across multiple AZs
* One Zone reduces costs but trades off availability
* IA options best for infrequently accessed data with minimum 30-day storage
* Throughput modes (Bursting/Provisioned) available across all classes
