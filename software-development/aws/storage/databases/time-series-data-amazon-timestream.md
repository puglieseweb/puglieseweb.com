# Time-Series Data (Amazon Timestream)

Amazon Timestream is a fully managed, serverless time series database service provided by AWS. It's designed specifically for collecting, storing, and analyzing time-series data at scale.&#x20;

**Time-Series Data** are data points that are logged over a series of time, allowing you to track your data. Example could be temperature readings from weather stations around the world, on the hour, every hour of the years.&#x20;

Examples:

* IoT. IoT sensors relay thousands, millions, and billions of points of information depending on the setup. One use case is for agriculture.&#x20;
* Analytics. Lafge websites such as Netflix serve millions of users per second. Need to analyze incoming and outgoing web traffic.&#x20;
* DevOps Applications. Applications taht change in response to users needs may need to be monitored continously so that can scale correctly.&#x20;

Amazon Timestream is a serverless, fully managed database servcie for time-series data. You can analyse trillions of events per day up to 1,000 times faster and at as little as **1/10th the cost of traditional relational databases.**







Key features and characteristics:

1. Purpose-built for time-series data:
   * Optimized for data with a timestamp component
   * Ideal for IoT applications, industrial telemetry, application monitoring, etc.
2. Scalability:
   * Automatically scales up or down to adjust to your workload
   * Can handle trillions of events per day
3. Performance:
   * Offers fast query performance for recent and historical data
   * Uses a multi-tiered storage architecture (in-memory for recent data, SSD for historical)
4. Cost-effective:
   * Pay only for the data you write, store, and query
   * Automated data lifecycle management
5. SQL compatibility:
   * Supports SQL-like queries for data analysis
   * Integrates with popular visualization and analytics tools
6. Built-in time series analytics functions:
   * Provides functions for common time series operations like smoothing, approximation, and interpolation
7. Serverless:
   * No servers to manage or provision
8. Integration with AWS ecosystem:
   * Works well with services like AWS IoT, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon SageMaker

Timestream fits into the observability landscape by providing a specialized database for time-series metrics. While it's not a direct replacement for services like CloudWatch Metrics, it can be used to store and analyze high-volume time-series data that might be too voluminous or specialized for traditional monitoring tools.
