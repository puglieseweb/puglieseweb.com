# Redshift's ACID compliance

Let me explain AWS Redshift's ACID compliance:

AWS Redshift provides partial ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, with some specific characteristics:

* Atomicity: Yes - Individual transactions are atomic. Either all operations in a transaction complete successfully, or none do.
* Consistency: Yes - Redshift maintains data consistency through transactions and constraints, though it has some limitations compared to traditional RDBMS systems.
* Isolation: Partial - Redshift uses Serializable Isolation, but with some key differences:
  1. Read operations don't acquire locks
  2. Write operations acquire table-level locks
  3. Doesn't support true row-level locking
  4. Long-running queries can be impacted by vacuum operations
* Durability: Yes - Data is automatically replicated across nodes within the cluster and backed up to S3.

However, it's important to note that Redshift is designed as a data warehouse, not an OLTP database. While it provides ACID properties, it's optimized for complex queries on large datasets rather than frequent small transactions.
