# File Gateway

Caching local files.



AWS File Gateway is a specific implementation of a file gateway service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here are the key features and details about AWS File Gateway:

1. Part of AWS Storage Gateway: It's one of the gateway types offered within the AWS Storage Gateway service, alongside Volume Gateway and Tape Gateway.
2. Amazon S3 Integration: AWS File Gateway provides a file interface that allows you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using standard file protocols.
3. Supported Protocols: It supports both NFS (versions 3 and 4.1) and SMB (versions 2 and 3) protocols, making it compatible with a wide range of applications and operating systems.
4. Local Cache: The gateway maintains a local cache for low-latency access to recently used data.
5. File Locking: It supports file locking for the SMB protocol to help maintain data consistency in multi-user environments.
6. Lifecycle Management: You can use S3 lifecycle policies to automatically move data to lower-cost storage classes like S3 Glacier.
7. Security Features:
   * Data is encrypted in transit using SSL/TLS
   * Data stored in S3 is encrypted at rest
   * Integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control
8. Hybrid Cloud Support: It allows for easy implementation of hybrid cloud architectures, combining on-premises systems with AWS cloud storage.
9. Backup and Disaster Recovery: Can be used as part of a backup or disaster recovery solution, storing copies of important data in S3.
10. Cost-Effective: Helps reduce storage costs by leveraging S3's pricing model and eliminating the need for large local storage arrays.
11. VMware Integration: **Can be deployed as a virtual machine in VMware environments.**
12. Monitoring: Integrates with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and alarming.

AWS File Gateway is particularly useful for organizations looking to extend their on-premises file-based applications to use S3 storage, enabling cloud-based workflows while maintaining local access speeds for frequently used data.
