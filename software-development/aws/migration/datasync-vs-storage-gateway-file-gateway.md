# DataSync VS Storage Gateway File Gateway

**Key Differences:**

| DataSync                                 | File Gateway                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Designed for migration and periodic sync | Designed for ongoing storage access |
| Point-in-time data movement              | Continuous access pattern           |
| No local caching                         | Local caching for frequent access   |
| Task-based operation                     | Mount point-based operation         |
| Pay per data transferred                 | Pay for storage and requests        |
| Multiple storage service support         | S3-focused only                     |
| Temporary deployment                     | Permanent infrastructure component  |

**When to Use Each:**

Use DataSync when:

* Performing large-scale data migrations
* Need scheduled periodic data transfers
* Moving data between AWS services
* Require automated validation and verification
* Need detailed transfer metrics and logging

Use File Gateway when:

* Requiring continuous access to cloud storage
* Need local caching for performance
* Want transparent S3 integration for applications
* Need file-share protocols (NFS/SMB)
* Implementing hybrid cloud storage architecture

**Integration Scenario:** They can be used together - DataSync for initial bulk data upload, then File Gateway for ongoing access and operations. This combination provides efficient migration and operational access patterns.
