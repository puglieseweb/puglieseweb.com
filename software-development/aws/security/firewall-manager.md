# Firewall Manager

AWS Network Firewall is a security management service in a single pane of glass. It allows you to centrally set up and manage firewall rules across multiple AWS accounts and applications in AWS Organizations.

With Firewall Manager, you can manage AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, and other AWS services. Firewall Manager is a managed service that is not installed on EC2 instances.



You can create:

* New AWS WAF rules for your Application Load Balancers, API Gateways, and Amazon CloudFront distributions
* Mitigate DDoS attacks using AWS Shield Advanced for Application Load Balancers, Elastic IP addresses, CloudFront distributions, and more.
