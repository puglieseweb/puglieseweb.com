# SAM

AWS SAM stands for AWS Serverless Application Model.

AWS SAM is an open-source framework developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for building serverless applications. It provides a simplified way to define the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application.

Key points about AWS SAM:

1. Simplified Resource Creation: SAM extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application.
2. Local Testing: It includes a CLI tool that helps you locally build, test, and debug serverless applications defined using SAM templates.
3. Integration with AWS Services: SAM integrates with other AWS services for application lifecycle management.
4. Infrastructure as Code: It allows you to describe your serverless application using YAML or JSON configuration files, embracing the infrastructure-as-code paradigm.
5. Single Deployment Configuration: With SAM, you can use a single configuration file to define your entire serverless application.
6. Open Source: AWS SAM is open-source, allowing developers to contribute to its development and customize it for their needs.

Using AWS SAM can significantly simplify the process of building, testing, and deploying serverless applications on AWS. It's particularly useful for developers who want to quickly set up and manage serverless architectures without dealing with the complexities of configuring each AWS service separately.
