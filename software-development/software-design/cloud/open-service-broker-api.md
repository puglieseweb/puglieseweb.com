# Open Service Broker API

The [Open Service brokers API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) defines an HTTP interface to manage the lifecycle of services.  Service brokers are responsible for:

* Provisioning \(creating or updating\) service instances
* Creating bindings between a service instance and a client application
* Deleting bindings between a service instance and a client application
* Deprovisioning \(deleting\) service instances.

### Implementation

* [Spring Boot open service broker](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-open-service-broker/docs/current/reference/html5/#introduction)
