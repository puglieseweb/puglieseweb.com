RDS for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing): Processes data for transactions in real time (e.g. customer orders, banking transactions, payments, and booking systems). OLTP is all about data processing and completing large numbers of small transactions in real time.

Redshift for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): Processes complex queries to analyzing historical data (e.g. analyzing net profit figures from the last 3 years and sales forcasting). OLAP is all about data analysis using large amounts of data, as well as complex queries that take a log time to complete.
