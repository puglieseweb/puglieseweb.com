# Serverless

Serverless is about leaving that management behind.

Key characteristic:

* Ease of Use: There is not much for us to do besides bringing our code. AWS handles almost everything for us.
* Event based: Serverless compute resources can be brought online in response to an event happening.
* Billing Model: "Pay as you go" in its purest form. You only pay for your provisioned resources and the length of runtime.
