# Monitoring

* Amazon CloudWatch: This is the closest AWS-native equivalent to Datadog. It provides:
  * Metrics collection and visualization
  * Log aggregation and analysis
  * Alerting and notification
  * Basic application performance monitoring
* AWS X-Ray: Offers distributed tracing capabilities, similar to Datadog's APM (Application Performance Monitoring).
* Amazon Managed Grafana: While not a direct Datadog equivalent, it provides powerful visualization capabilities that can be used with various AWS data sources.
* AWS CloudTrail: For auditing API calls across your AWS infrastructure.
