# Monitoring

* Amazon CloudWatch: This is the closest AWS-native equivalent to Datadog. It provides:
  * Metrics collection and visualization
  * Log aggregation and analysis
  * Alerting and notification
  * Basic application performance monitoring
* AWS X-Ray: Offers distributed tracing capabilities, similar to Datadog's APM (Application Performance Monitoring).
* Amazon Managed Grafana: While not a direct Datadog equivalent, it provides powerful visualization capabilities that can be used with various AWS data sources.
* AWS CloudTrail: For auditing API calls across your AWS infrastructure.



## Metrics, Logs, and Traces in AWS

The main pillars of observability  in AWS are:

1. Metrics: Primarily handled by CloudWatch Metrics
2. Logs: Managed through CloudWatch Logs and OpenSearch Service
3. Traces: Provided by AWS X-Ray

Other services enhance these pillars with additional capabilities like visualization (Managed Grafana), anomaly detection (DevOps Guru, Lookout for Metrics), and specialized monitoring for containers (Managed Service for Prometheus).

### Metrics

* **Definition**: Numeric values measured over time
* **AWS Service**: Amazon CloudWatch Metrics
* **Use Cases**:
  * Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
  * Application performance (response times, error rates)
  * Business KPIs (transactions per second, active users)
* **Characteristics**:
  * Aggregated data
  * Regular intervals
  * Lightweight
  * Good for alerting and dashboards

### Logs

* **Definition**: Timestamped records of events
* **AWS Service**: Amazon CloudWatch Logs
* **Use Cases**:
  * Application logs
  * Security logs
  * Audit trails
  * Debugging
* **Characteristics**:
  * Detailed information
  * Unstructured or semi-structured
  * Event-driven
  * Good for in-depth analysis and troubleshooting

### Traces

* **Definition**: End-to-end journey of a request through a distributed system
* **AWS Service**: AWS X-Ray
* **Use Cases**:
  * Identifying performance bottlenecks
  * Understanding service dependencies
  * Debugging distributed transactions
* **Characteristics**:
  * Spans multiple services
  * Provides timing and error information
  * Shows request path and service interactions
  * Good for complex, distributed system analysis
