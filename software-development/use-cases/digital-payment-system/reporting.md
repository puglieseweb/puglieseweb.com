Key Considerations for Implementation:

1. Access Control:

```markdown
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-tenant data segregation
- Audit logging of report access
```

2. Delivery Methods:

* Real-time dashboards
* Scheduled email reports
* API access
* Export capabilities (CSV, PDF, Excel)

3. Customization Options:

* Configurable date ranges
* Custom filters
* Saved report templates
* Scheduled deliveries

4. Performance Considerations:

* Pre-aggregated data for common reports
* Caching strategies
* Asynchronous report generation for heavy reports
* Query optimization

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific report type or discuss implementation details for any particular category?
